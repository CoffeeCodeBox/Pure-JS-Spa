# Pure JS SPA TEMPLATE

A minimal single-page app template built with plain JavaScript.  
No frameworks, no build tools â€” just HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Features
- Single HTML entry point
- No dependencies
- Easy to read and modify

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser.
*Note: For routing to work, serve with a local server (e.g. `npx serve`).
